# Changelog

All notable changes to flowme are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.0.9] — 2026-04-27

Strategic overlay refactor and debug-logging gate.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **All native overlay types removed** (`camera`, `switch`, `sensor`, `button`). Only `type: custom` is supported from this version onward. Migrate by wrapping entity display in a standard HA card, e.g.:

  ```yaml
  # Before (removed)
  overlays:
    - type: camera
      entity: camera.front_door
      position: { x: 80, y: 50 }
      size: { width: 20, height: 15 }

  # After (v1.0.9+)
  overlays:
    - type: custom
      position: { x: 80, y: 50 }
      size: { width: 20, height: 15 }
      card:
        type: picture-entity
        entity: camera.front_door
        show_name: false
  ```

- **`card_config:` renamed to `card:`** on custom overlays. Update all existing configs.
- **`defaults.camera_refresh_interval`** removed (camera overlay type gone).
- **`tap_action`, `entity`, `label`, `refresh_interval`, `offline_label`** removed from `OverlayConfig`.

### Added

- `card: <ha-card-config>` on custom overlays — accepts any installed Lovelace card type.
- `visible: false` on overlays — hides the wrapper with `display: none`.
- `opacity: 0–1` on overlays — CSS opacity applied to the wrapper element.
- `debug: true` top-level config flag — gates ALL `console.log`/`console.warn` output. Default `false` = silent production operation. `console.error` always fires.
- `setOverlayVisible` and `setOverlayOpacity` editor commands.

### Changed

- Overlay position now anchors at **top-left** corner (`left: x%, top: y%`). Previously centred.
- `getStubConfig()` includes one example `custom` overlay with `card: { type: entity, entity: sensor.example_sensor }`.
- Debug `setTimeout` blocks in `firstUpdated` removed entirely.
- `syncCameraTimer` removed from `flowme-card.ts`.
- All renderer diagnostic logging (`rlog`) now routes through `dlog` and is gated by `config.debug`.

## [1.0.8] — 2026-04-27

Security and hardcoding audit cleanup. No new rendering features.

### Security fix (CRITICAL)

**C1** — `DEBUG_WATCH_ENTITIES` in `flowme-card.ts` hardcoded five private home-sensor entity IDs (`sensor.sirbu_dumitra_*`) which ended up in the compiled bundle. The fixed code derives the watch list dynamically from the card's own config (flows, nodes, overlays, weather entity) so no personal entity IDs are ever embedded in the source.

### Added — `defaults:` top-level config block

A new optional `defaults:` block lets users tune card-level rendering behaviour without touching individual flows or nodes. All fields are optional; built-in values remain unchanged when omitted:

```yaml
defaults:
  node_radius: 12           # node dot size in px (was hardcoded)
  camera_refresh_interval: 10  # seconds; also overrideable per-overlay
  burst_trigger_ratio: 0.9  # fraction of peak that enters burst mode
  burst_sustain_ms: 5000    # ms above trigger before burst activates
  burst_max_particles: 20   # particle cap in burst mode
  dot_radius: 5             # flow dot/circle radius in px
  line_width: 2             # flow outline stroke width in px
```

### Added — `domain_colors:` top-level config block

Overrides the built-in energy id-pattern defaults without having to set `color:` on every flow:

```yaml
domain_colors:
  solar: "#FFD700"    # built-in default
  grid: "#1EB4FF"
  battery: "#32DC50"
  load: "#FF8C1E"
```

Partial overrides are allowed. Keys not set fall through to the built-in defaults.

### Added — per-camera-overlay `refresh_interval` and `offline_label`

```yaml
overlays:
  - type: camera
    entity: camera.my_camera
    position: { x: 50, y: 50 }
    refresh_interval: 30      # override defaults.camera_refresh_interval
    offline_label: "Camera offline"  # shown in placeholder tooltip; default ""
```

`refresh_interval` and `offline_label` are only valid on `type: camera` overlays; the validator rejects them on other types.

### Fixed — medium/low audit findings

- **M7** — Editor overlay entity placeholder strings changed from opinionated names (`sensor.indoor_temperature`, `switch.porch_light`, `camera.front_door`, `script.bedtime`) to clearly generic `sensor.my_power_sensor`, `switch.my_switch`, `camera.my_camera`, `script.my_script`.
- **M8** — Weather entity picker placeholder changed from `weather.home` to `weather.forecast_home` (the most common HA default). The value is placeholder text only and is never auto-saved to config.
- **M9** — Houdini worklet fallback particle colour changed from `#A78BFA` (purple — domain colour for generic/hvac) to `#FFFFFF` (white) so the fallback has no semantic hue that could confuse colour debugging.
- **L9** — `'camera offline'` hardcoded English string removed from the camera placeholder `title` attribute. The `offline_label` overlay config field replaces it; the default is an empty string (icon only, no text).

### Tests

- `tests/unit/validate-config.test.ts` — `defaults` block (full and partial), `burst_trigger_ratio > 1`, non-positive values, `domain_colors` full and partial, camera overlay `refresh_interval` / `offline_label`, `refresh_interval` rejection on non-camera type.
- `tests/unit/flow-profiles.test.ts` — `domainColors` parameter override (full and partial).
- `tests/smoke/flowme-card.smoke.test.ts` — C1 fix (no `sirbu`/`dumitra` in class source), `domain_colors` override flows to node fill, `defaults.node_radius` applied to node dot.

## [1.0.7] — 2026-04-27

Two visual fixes reported on top of v1.0.6: every flow and node was rendering in the energy profile's positive default colour, and node circles drifted upward whenever their value/label was toggled on. Both are now resolved by introducing a single colour-resolution helper and pinning the node's CSS anchor to the dot's centre.

### Added — `flow.color` shorthand and id-pattern defaults

Flows can now set a single `color:` field as a shortcut that applies to both directions:

```yaml
flows:
  - id: solar1
    from_node: pv1
    to_node: inverter
    entity: sensor.pv1_power
    color: "#FFD700"
```

Resolution order (highest precedence first), applied identically by both renderers and by the node-fill walk:

1. `flow.color_positive` / `flow.color_negative` — direction-specific override.
2. `flow.color` — shorthand applied to both directions.
3. `defaultDomainFlowColor(domain, flow.id)` — built-in residential defaults (energy domain only):
   - `solar*`, `pv*`, `pv_string_*` → `#FFD700` (gold)
   - `grid*`, `grid_flow`, `grid_power` → `#1EB4FF` (blue)
   - `battery*`, `batt*` → `#32DC50` (green)
   - `load*`, `consumption*`, `house*` → `#FF8C1E` (orange)
4. `profile.default_color_positive` / `profile.default_color_negative` — profile fallback.

Pattern matching is word-boundary aware so `solarium_temperature` and `overload_count` do **not** trigger.

### Fixed — nodes adopt their connected flow's colour

`nodeFlowColor` now resolves through the same helper for every flow that touches the node, then:

- if all connecting flows resolve to the same colour, the node adopts it;
- if multiple distinct colours connect (the inverter case in a residential energy diagram), the node renders in the new `NEUTRAL_NODE_COLOR` (`#CCCCCC`) so it stops claiming any single flow's hue;
- if no flow touches the node, it falls through to the profile default as before.

Combined with the id-pattern defaults this means a typical residential energy config now renders solar nodes gold, grid nodes blue, battery nodes green, load nodes orange and the inverter neutral grey — all without any explicit `color:` config.

`node.color` still wins when set explicitly.

### Fixed — node circle stays anchored at (x%, y%)

The `.node` wrapper used `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`, which centred the *entire flex column* (dot + label + value) on the configured point. Toggling `show_value` or adding a label therefore shifted the dot upward, breaking alignment with house-photo backgrounds the user had calibrated against.

The wrapper now exposes a `--flowme-dot-size` CSS variable (set inline from `node.size`) and uses `transform: translate(-50%, calc(var(--flowme-dot-size, 12px) / -2))` instead. The dot is the wrapper's first flex child at y = 0, so this offset puts the dot's *centre* on the configured point regardless of whether the column also contains a label or value, which now flow downward from that fixed anchor.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/flow-profiles.test.ts` — `defaultDomainFlowColor` patterns (solar/pv/grid/battery/load), `resolveFlowColor` precedence chain (explicit ↦ shorthand ↦ id-pattern ↦ profile), domain isolation (id patterns only fire for energy).
- `tests/unit/validate-config.test.ts` — `flow.color` shorthand parses through to the validated config.
- `tests/smoke/flowme-card.smoke.test.ts` — solar node renders gold without explicit colour, inverter node connecting to four distinct flow colours falls back to `#CCCCCC`, `flow.color` shorthand overrides id-pattern defaults, and the `.node` wrapper carries `--flowme-dot-size` plus the configured `left`/`top` so the dot centre stays anchored.

## [1.0.6] — 2026-04-27

Speed-curve rework: the v1.0.5 logarithmic curve is replaced by a sigmoid in log10-value space, parameterised per domain by percentile anchors (`threshold`, `p50`, `peak`) and overrideable per flow.

### Changed — unified sigmoid curve

Every profile now uses the same shape function:

```
v      = max(|value|, threshold)
ratio  = log10(v / p50)
factor = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * ratio))
ms     = max_duration - factor * (max_duration - min_duration)
```

Universal constants (overrideable per flow):

- `max_duration = 9000` ms — at and below `threshold`, animation reads as a slow, visible trickle.
- `min_duration = 700` ms — asymptote the sigmoid approaches at large magnitudes.
- `steepness   = 1.5`     — controls how sharply the curve transitions through `p50`.

Per-domain calibration:

| Domain   | `threshold` | `p50` | `peak`  | Units  |
| -------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Energy   | 30          | 800   | 10 000  | W      |
| Water    | 0.3         | 6     | 60      | L/min  |
| Network  | 0.05        | 50    | 10 000  | Mbps   |
| HVAC     | 5           | 200   | 3 000   | CFM    |
| Gas      | 0.005       | 0.5   | 10      | m³/h   |
| Generic  | 1           | 100   | 10 000  | —      |

The sigmoid is *asymptotic at the upper end* — values past `peak` keep getting faster but never reach `min_duration`. Burst-density mode (introduced in v1.0.5) compensates: sustained magnitudes ≥ 0.9 × `peak` for ≥ 5 s now multiply particle count by `burst_density_multiplier` (default 1.5, capped at 20). Burst now reads its trigger from the *resolved* peak, so per-flow overrides flow through correctly.

### Added — per-flow `speed_curve_override`

Every parameter of the curve is independently overrideable per flow, falling back to the profile, then to the universal constants. Useful for tuning a single sensor without forking a profile:

```yaml
flows:
  - id: ev_charger
    entity: sensor.ev_charger_power
    domain: energy
    speed_curve_override:
      threshold: 50
      p50: 1500          # higher median for an EV-only sensor
      peak: 11000        # 11 kW residential charger ceiling
      max_duration: 8000
      min_duration: 600
      # steepness optional; defaults to 1.5
```

Resolution order for any field: `speed_curve_override.X` → profile.X → universal constant. The legacy `flow.threshold` shortcut still works as `speed_curve_override.threshold` (the override field wins when both are set), so existing configs need no changes.

### Removed

- `FlowProfile.speed_range_min` / `speed_range_max` / `visibility_threshold` — replaced by `threshold` / `p50` / `peak`.
- `logCurveDuration()` — replaced by `sigmoidSpeedCurve()` and the `resolveSpeedCurveParams()` helper.

These are internal API changes; the public YAML schema is backward-compatible (only additive — `speed_curve_override` is new, everything else still works).

### Validation

`speed_curve_override` blocks are validated:

- Numeric fields must be finite. `threshold`, `p50`, `peak` and `steepness` must be `> 0`. Durations must be `≥ 50` ms.
- `min_duration < max_duration` when both are set.
- Unknown keys are rejected so typos like `stepness` surface immediately.

### Files touched

`src/types.ts`, `src/utils.ts`, `src/flow-profiles/{energy,water,network,hvac,gas,generic}.ts`, `src/animation/svg-renderer.ts`, `src/animation/houdini-renderer.ts`, `src/validate-config.ts`, `src/flowme-card.ts` (CARD_VERSION), `package.json`, `tests/unit/flow-profiles.test.ts`, `tests/unit/validate-config.test.ts`.

## [1.0.5] — 2026-04-26

Residential recalibration: every domain now shares one logarithmic speed curve, bounded between a visibly-alive slowest duration and a brisk fastest, with a new burst-density mode for saturated flows.

### Changed — unified speed curve

All profiles now use a single shape function, `logCurveDuration(value, domain_min, domain_max, 4500, 600)`, parameterised per domain:

```
speed_factor = log10(value / domain_min) / log10(domain_max / domain_min)
duration_ms  = 4500 - speed_factor * (4500 - 600)
```

At or below `domain_min` → 4500 ms (slowest *visible* duration — still a living pulse, never the 8000 ms frozen look of v1.0.2). At or above `domain_max` → 600 ms (brisk without blurring). Logarithmic mid-range spreads evenly across each domain's residential operating envelope.

Per-domain calibration:

| Domain   | `speed_range_min` | `speed_range_max` | Typical residential coverage |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Energy   | 50 W              | 10 000 W          | Idle-load cut-off → whole-house peak / EV charging |
| Water    | 0.5 L/min         | 50 L/min          | Dripping tap → shower + washing machine |
| Network  | 0.1 Mbps          | 10 000 Mbps       | Background chatter → 10 Gbps fibre |
| HVAC     | 10 CFM            | 2000 CFM          | Fan-off threshold → max residential ducted |
| Gas      | 0.01 m³/h         | 10 m³/h           | Pilot light → full central heating + cooker |
| Generic  | 1                 | 1000              | Sensible middle-ground for unknown domains |

Each profile's `visibility_threshold` defaults to its `speed_range_min`, so flows below the interesting range are hidden altogether (v1.0.4 had these drifting apart, which left 2 W LED bulbs drawing frozen-looking flows on the energy profile).

Custom per-flow `speed_multiplier` still applies on top of the curve output.

### Added — burst-density mode

When a flow's absolute magnitude stays at or above `0.9 × speed_range_max` for **≥ 5 seconds**, its particle count is multiplied by `profile.burst_density_multiplier` (default 1.5) and capped at 20 particles. Dropping below the 90% ratio resets the timer immediately. Implemented in `SvgRenderer.updateBurstState` with per-flow `burstEnteredAt` / `burstActive` tracking and a single `[FlowMe Renderer] burst ENTER / EXIT / PENDING` log per transition (not per `applyFlow`). Applies to `dot`, `square`, and `pulse` shapes; `wave` is a no-op until we add an amplitude boost.

### Added — APIs

- `logCurveDuration(value, domainMin, domainMax, maxDurationMs=4500, minDurationMs=600)` exported from `src/utils.ts`.
- `UNIVERSAL_MAX_DURATION_MS = 4500` and `UNIVERSAL_MIN_DURATION_MS = 600` constants for external tooling that wants the same bounds.
- `FlowProfile.speed_range_min: number` and `speed_range_max: number` (both required on every profile going forward).
- `FlowProfile.burst_density_multiplier?: number` (optional, defaults to 1.5, set to 1 to disable for a profile).

### Changed — debug logs preserved and expanded

All v1.0.3 `[FlowMe]` / `[FlowMe Renderer]` logs remain. Added:

- `applyFlow` log now includes `burstMultiplier` next to `dur` / `color` / `speedMult`.
- `updateBurstState` emits `burst PENDING` / `burst ENTER` / `burst EXIT` transitions with the exact magnitude, trigger ratio, and sustain time.
- `applyParticles` / `applyPulse` log the base / multiplier / final particle count when burst is active.

Per user instruction, the full debug channel stays in place until explicit removal.

### Fixed — distinct direction colours on water / gas / generic

Before v1.0.5 the `water`, `gas`, and `generic` profiles shipped with identical `default_color_positive` and `default_color_negative`, so a bidirectional sensor's sign flip was visible only via the direction-of-travel animation — and on `pulse` shapes (gas) it was invisible altogether because pulse is a symmetric expanding circle. Each negative colour is now distinct but kept inside the same domain-family palette:

| Domain  | Positive | Negative (new) | Rationale |
| ------- | -------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Water   | `#3B82F6` blue | `#06B6D4` cyan | Still reads as "water", clearly flipped |
| Gas     | `#FB923C` orange | `#A16207` dark amber | Warm/combustion family, unambiguous reverse |
| Generic | `#A78BFA` violet | `#34D399` emerald | Maximum-contrast pair for arbitrary bidirectional sensors |

`energy`, `hvac`, and `network` already shipped with distinct positive/negative colours and are unchanged.

### Tests

- Rewrote `tests/unit/flow-profiles.test.ts`: 20+ anchor-point tests across every profile driven by a shared `expectedDuration()` reference implementation, so any drift in the universal shape function lights the whole suite up. Explicit `speed_range_min` / `speed_range_max` / `burst_density_multiplier` declarations are also pinned.
- Added 5 dedicated tests for `logCurveDuration` covering clamp-low, clamp-high, log-midpoint, custom bounds, and defensive nonsense-range handling.
- Added 2 regression tests pinning distinct positive/negative colour pairs for every profile (both that they differ at all, and that the specific v1.0.5 choices for water/gas/generic don't silently drift).

139 → 152 tests. All pass.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-26

Energy profile recalibration for kW-reporting power sensors.

### Fixed

- **Flows appeared frozen on dashboards with kW sensors.** The energy `speed_curve` is defined over watts — `dur = clamp(8000 - log10(magnitude/10) * 2000, 400, 8000)` — but if a sensor reports `2.0` with `unit_of_measurement: 'kW'` the curve received `2` instead of `2000`, producing `log10(0.2) = -0.7` and clamping to the 8000 ms ceiling. The fix adds a per-profile `unit_scale` map; the card now reads `state.attributes.unit_of_measurement`, looks it up against the profile's scale table, and multiplies the raw parsed value into the profile's base unit before calling `renderer.updateFlow`. A 2 kW grid draw now reaches the curve as 2000 W and animates at ~3000 ms as expected. Unknown or missing units pass through unchanged so v1.0.2 configs that implicitly fed watts keep working.

### Added

- `FlowProfile.unit_scale?: Readonly<Record<string, number>>` — declares the unit → base-unit conversion table. Energy profile ships with `{ W: 1, Wh: 1, kW: 1000, kWh: 1000, MW: 1e6, mW: 1e-3 }`. Matching is case-insensitive and trimmed so HA locales that report `KW`, `kw`, or `" kW "` all resolve correctly. Other profiles can opt in the same way when their domains have common alternate units (MB/s vs Mbps for network, °F vs °C for HVAC — not implemented yet, just the mechanism is there).
- `scaleSensorValue(value, unitAttr, scaleMap)` utility alongside `parseSensorValue`, returning `{ value, factor, matchedUnit }` so the `[FlowMe]` debug channel can log exactly which unit was matched and what multiplier was applied next to every `updateFlow` call.
- New unit tests: six `scaleSensorValue` cases (kW, KW, kw, MW, mW, pass-through, identity-W) and a regression test on `energyProfile.unit_scale` pinning the four primary factors so the kW bug can never silently regress.

### Unchanged (for the record)

- Node value display still reads the sensor's native unit via `state.attributes.unit_of_measurement` and shows the native value (`1.5 kW`, not `1500 W`) — the unit scaling only runs on the renderer-input path, not on the display path. The "1 W W" doubled-unit guard added in v1.0.2 still applies.
- The `energy.speed_curve` formula itself is unchanged. The header comment used to claim anchor points of `100 W → 4000 ms` / `1000 W → 2000 ms`, but the code and the test-suite both always produced `6000` / `4000`. Comment rewritten to match reality (`10 W → 8000 / 100 W → 6000 / 1 kW → 4000 / 10 kW → 2000`, clamped to 400–8000 ms).

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-26

**Diagnostic build.** No rendering logic was changed from v1.0.2 — only extensive `console.warn` instrumentation prefixed `[FlowMe]` and `[FlowMe Renderer]` was added so we can see the runtime values of every relevant code path while we track down the persistent "no animation / wrong colours / doubled units" report. The next patch release will contain the actual fix once the logs identify which stage is breaking.

### Added

- `src/debug-log.ts` — single `dlog()` channel so every diagnostic message is greppable by the `[FlowMe]` tag in the Home Assistant browser console.
- `setConfig()` dumps the full validated config and a flow/node/overlay summary.
- The `hass` property setter now logs (a) the hardcoded watch-list of the user's five solar/grid/battery/load sensors and (b) every flow-entity value resolved from `hass.states`.
- `willUpdate` logs each `updateFlow(flowId, entity, raw, parsed)` call as values are pushed to the renderer.
- `firstUpdated` schedules three timed inspections: `t+0ms` shadow root + `<svg>` presence, `t+2000ms` first `animateMotion` element with its `dur` and `<mpath href>` resolution check, `t+3000ms` a 2 KB slice of the full shadow DOM HTML.
- `createRenderer` logs the chosen renderer class, whether `?flowme_renderer=` was set, whether `CSS.paintWorklet` is available, and whether both Houdini prerequisites (`paintWorklet` + `registerProperty`) are present.
- `SvgRenderer.init` logs the incoming config, the container bounding rect, and which kind of root (`ShadowRoot` vs `Document`) the `<svg>` was appended to.
- `SvgRenderer.buildSkeleton` logs every flow-group append with `pathId`, the resolved `d` attribute, the shape, and a 200-char slice of the group's `outerHTML`.
- `SvgRenderer.applyFlow` logs the computed `visible` decision (value / magnitude / threshold) and, when visible, the resolved `domain`, `shape`, raw speed-curve output, dur ms, direction, and final colour (including all colour-source candidates so we can see which one "won").
- `SvgRenderer.applyParticles` logs the first particle's installed `animateMotion` dur, mpath target, and a slice of its outerHTML, then a summary `SVG flow created` line with path `d` and particle count.
- `renderOverlayHost` logs each overlay's type, id, entity, position, size, and current entity state.

### Workflow

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` now auto-detects hyphenated tags (e.g. `v1.1.0-beta`) and publishes them as GitHub prereleases — kept for future use even though v1.0.x remains full-release only.

### Next step

After installing this build, reload the dashboard with DevTools open, filter the console by `[FlowMe]`, and share the full output. The log points above are designed to pinpoint exactly one of: wrong renderer chosen, entity values not reaching the card, `applyFlow` hidden by threshold, `<animateMotion dur="...">` not updated, or `<mpath href="#flowme-path-*">` failing to resolve inside the shadow root. The next release will contain the actual fix.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-26

Second bugfix after first real-world dashboard deploy.

### Fixed

- **No animation on flow lines** — the renderer factory now defaults to the SVG renderer. In Home Assistant's Chromium embed the paint-worklet API is reported as supported but CSP / blob-URL handling often silently blocks the painter from ever registering, leaving flows completely invisible with no console error. SVG + `animateMotion` renders the same shapes reliably everywhere. The Houdini renderer stays available behind `?flowme_renderer=houdini`, and the card now catches renderer-init failures and automatically falls back to SVG instead of crashing.
- **Energy `visibility_threshold` lowered from 10 W → 1 W** — a single LED bulb (2 W) or a router (6 W) now animates a visible flow at idle. Users can still raise this per-flow via `threshold:` in YAML.
- **All nodes rendering the same default colour** — a node with no explicit `color:` now inherits the `color_positive` of any flow that starts or ends at it. Set `color_positive` on your solar / grid / battery / load flows and the connected nodes pick the matching hue automatically.
- **Doubled unit of measurement ("1 W W")** — node value text now uses the sensor's own `unit_of_measurement` attribute when present and never appends the profile `unit_label` on top of a unit the sensor already reported. Falls back to `profile.describe()` when the sensor has no unit attribute.

### Added

- **`?flowme_debug=1` URL parameter** — forces every flow to animate at a fixed 2 s regardless of value, bypassing `speed_curve` and `visibility_threshold`, and logs each `updateFlow`/`applyFlow` step in the console. Pointed-and-shootable debugger for "why isn't my flow moving" symptoms; described under Troubleshooting in the README.
- **Camera overlay auto-refresh** — the camera snapshot now refreshes every 10 s via a cache-busted URL, driven by a timer that only runs when at least one camera overlay is present.
- **Camera offline placeholder** — when the camera entity is missing, `unavailable`, `unknown`, or has no `entity_picture`, the overlay now renders a grey box with a camera-glyph SVG instead of a half-blank tile.
- **Switch overlay touch targets** — switch overlays now have a 44 × 44 px minimum touch target regardless of configured size percentages, matching the WCAG / iOS HIG guidance. `.is-on` / `.is-off` now also show a subtle green/red inset ring for instant at-a-glance state feedback.
- **Renderer diagnostic log** — the card now logs `[flowme] using <svg|houdini> renderer` on init, plus `[flowme] renderer init failed — falling back to SVG` when the Houdini path rejects.

### Tests

- +2 cases for doubled-unit fix and camera offline placeholder (now 131 tests, all green).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-26

First bugfix based on feedback from initial HA deploy.

### Fixed

- **HA Sections-view "does not fully support resizing" warning** — `flowme-card` now implements both `getLayoutOptions()` and `getGridOptions()` returning sensible grid bounds derived from the configured `aspect_ratio`. `getCardSize()` was also tightened to match the card's actual aspect rather than always returning 5.
- **Flows now support a straight line from source to sink** — `flow.waypoints` is optional in YAML. Omit it entirely for a straight line; the validator normalises `undefined` → `[]` and the renderer already handled two-point paths.
- **`background.default` is optional** — omit it (or set `""`) and the card renders with a neutral placeholder. The stub config returned from `getStubConfig()` now ships with an empty background so the card works immediately after adding it to a dashboard, without the user first having to copy any image into `/config/www/flowme/`.
- **Silent "no flow visible" state** — the card now logs a clear `[flowme]` console warning (once per flow/entity pair) when a flow's entity is missing from `hass.states` or is in the `unavailable` / `unknown` state. This makes it obvious why a flow isn't animating.

### Changed

- **Editor entity inputs → `<ha-entity-picker>`** — every entity field in the visual editor (node entity, flow entity, overlay entity, weather entity) now uses HA's native entity picker with a domain filter:
  - Node entity: `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `input_number`, `number`
  - Flow entity: `sensor`, `input_number`, `number`
  - Overlay entity: filtered by overlay type (switches get `switch/light/input_boolean/fan/cover`, sensors get `sensor/binary_sensor/input_number/number`, cameras get `camera`, buttons get `script/automation/button/input_button`)
  - Weather entity: `weather` only
  - Falls back to a plain `<input>` with a `<datalist>` of matching entities on HA versions where `ha-entity-picker` hasn't registered yet.
- **Flow inspector now lets you edit the flow's entity** — it used to display it read-only.

### Tests

- Added cases for waypoints-optional, background-optional, and the new `getLayoutOptions` / `getGridOptions` surface.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-26

First stable release. All six domain profiles, full editor, auto-routing, weather backgrounds, interactive overlays — plus the test suite, docs and release tooling required for public distribution.

### Added

- **Test suite** — 125 unit + smoke tests across 8 files, running in Vitest + happy-dom:
  - `utils.test.ts` — clamp, lerp, percent/pixel conversion, path length, progress sampling, SVG path building, sensor value parsing, debounce (including cancel), aspect-ratio parsing.
  - `flow-profiles.test.ts` — spec-exact speed curves + describe formatting for all six domain profiles (energy, water, network, HVAC, gas, generic) including their clamping, `getProfile()` domain dispatch.
  - `pathfinding.test.ts` — `buildCostGrid` (edge-to-cost mapping + min-cost clamp + OOB behaviour), `findPath` (uniform grid straight line, start===end, OOB endpoints, cheap-corridor preference, turn-penalty straight-line tie break), `simplifyCollinear` (empty/short paths, straight run collapse, L-shape elbow preservation, zig-zag preservation).
  - `undo-stack.test.ts` — push / undo / redo / no-op when prev===next / redo-clears-on-new-push / 100-deep cap / no-op on empty stacks / clear + fan-out to multiple subscribers.
  - `url-scan.test.ts` — every disallowed scheme (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:`, `file:`), case-insensitive prefix match, recursive array walk, recursive nested-object walk, cycle safety via `WeakSet`, clean-config happy path, `assertSafeCardConfig` throw behaviour.
  - `validate-config.test.ts` — happy paths for minimal + full configs + full-overlay configs, failure branches for: non-object root, wrong `type`, unknown domain, missing nodes, duplicate node/overlay ids, out-of-range positions, flows pointing at unknown nodes, `speed_multiplier` out of range, bad `aspect_ratio`, disallowed URL prefixes, every overlay-schema rule (unknown type, missing entity, card_config only on custom, unsafe URL scheme inside card_config, bad `size`, unknown `tap_action`).
  - `editor-commands.test.ts` — clamp/snap helpers, id generators, node move/add/delete (with cascade to flows), label set/clear, flow add/delete, waypoint insert clamp/move/delete, every overlay command (add/move/delete/setSize/setType/setEntity/setLabel/setTapAction/setCardConfig), background + weather commands (setDefault, transition duration, setWeatherStateImage, deleteWeatherState, renameWeatherState).
  - `flowme-card.smoke.test.ts` — registers the custom element, mounts in happy-dom with a stub hass, asserts the shadow DOM contains the expected structure, asserts validation errors surface cleanly, verifies static `getConfigElement()` / `getStubConfig()` return valid values.
- **Release workflow** `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Triggered on any `v*` tag push:
  - Runs lint + type-check + type-check:tests + vitest + build.
  - Verifies the tag version matches `package.json` AND `CARD_VERSION` in `src/flowme-card.ts`.
  - Computes SHA-256 checksums for the built bundle and source map.
  - Extracts the matching CHANGELOG section and publishes a GitHub Release with the bundle, source map, and checksum files attached.
- **CI upgrade** — `ci.yml` now additionally type-checks the test directory and runs the full test suite on every push and PR.
- **Full README** — complete config reference (top-level, `Background`, `Node`, `Flow`, `Overlay`), per-domain YAML examples for all six domains, security model explanation, troubleshooting section covering invalid configs, CORS-tainted canvas on `Suggest path`, stalled animations, HACS compatibility errors.
- **TESTING.md** — manual pre-release checklist covering automated baseline, visual smoke test in a real HA instance, renderer selection, editor UX, HACS install flow, release integrity, security sanity.
- **HACS.md** — submission checklist for the default-repository PR.
- **Minimum HA version** `"2024.1.0"` declared in `hacs.json`. Tested on 2026.4.x.
- **`npm run check`** one-shot script: `lint → type-check → type-check:tests → test → build`.
- **`npm run test:coverage`** using `@vitest/coverage-v8`.
- **Dev-dep security** bumped to patched versions: vitest 2.1.9, @vitest/coverage-v8 2.1.9, vite 5.4.21, happy-dom 20.9.0. All critical CVEs resolved; remaining esbuild dev-server moderate only affects `vite` dev-server (we use `vite build` in CI).

### Changed

- Version bumped to **1.0.0** in `package.json` and `CARD_VERSION` banner.
- README's "Status" line rewritten to reflect v1.0.0 scope and supported HA versions.

### Removed

- Nothing — v1.0.0 is strictly additive over v0.5.0.

### Deferred to v1.1+

- HVAC temperature-gradient colour interpolation (still waiting on the secondary-entity schema).
- Editor multi-select + **"Suggest path from exactly two selected nodes"**.
- Real-browser end-to-end tests via Playwright (the happy-dom smoke test covers the critical register/mount/error-surface flow; Playwright tracked for a later minor).
- Ripple / toast / keyboard activation feedback on overlay taps.
- Standalone `npm run dev` demo page with a mock `hass`.
- Full screenshot set for the HACS submission (user-supplied content).

### Post-release policy

From v1.0.0 onward, `main` is protected: all changes land via PR. The direct-to-`main` workflow used during phases 1–5 is retired.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Interactive overlays over the background** for all five spec-defined types:
  - `sensor` — chip showing entity state and unit; tap opens HA's more-info dialog.
  - `switch` — animated track + thumb reflecting `on`/`off`; tap calls `homeassistant.toggle`.
  - `button` — plain label chip; tap toggles the bound entity or fires the configured action.
  - `camera` — renders the entity's `entity_picture` attribute as a live thumbnail; tap opens more-info.
  - `custom` — mounts an arbitrary Lovelace card via `window.loadCardHelpers().createCardElement()` in a new `<flowme-custom-overlay>` wrapper. The wrapper forwards `hass` updates and tears the child card down on config change.
- **Security: custom-overlay URL scanner** (`src/overlays/url-scan.ts`). Recursively walks any user-supplied `card_config` and rejects strings carrying `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:` or `file:` schemes before the config ever reaches `createCardElement`. The scan runs twice: once at config validation time (so bad YAML never boots the card) and once at mount time (so late JSON edits from the editor are caught before they mount).
- **Editor: overlay authoring.** New `+ Overlay` toolbar button prompts for the overlay type, then drops the overlay at the next click. Overlays render as dashed boxes on the canvas with a live label chip showing `label`/`entity`/type; they are draggable with `Shift`-snap to the 8% grid and have a bottom-right resize handle (also `Shift`-snaps to whole percent). Right-click deletes after confirmation.
- **Editor: overlay inspector.** Selecting an overlay opens a panel with a type dropdown, entity field (autocomplete-friendly placeholder per type), label, width/height %, tap-action override, and a JSON editor for the custom-overlay card config. JSON is parsed, then revalidated through the full config validator so unsafe URLs are rejected with a clear error.
- New editor commands: `addOverlay`, `deleteOverlay`, `moveOverlay`, `setOverlaySize`, `setOverlayType`, `setOverlayEntity`, `setOverlayLabel`, `setOverlayTapAction`, `setOverlayCardConfig`.
- `OverlayConfig` gains `id`, `label`, `tap_action`. The validator enforces unique ids, required entity for non-custom types, required `card_config` for `custom`, positive size ≤ 100%, and tap-action enum membership.
- `HomeAssistant` shim gains an optional `callService` so the card compiles against older typings.

### Changed

- Card version banner bumped to 0.5.0.
- `renderOverlayPlaceholder` in `flowme-card.ts` replaced by real overlay rendering through `renderOverlayHost` from `src/overlays/render.ts`.

### Deferred to later versions

- Picture-glob live MJPEG/HLS camera streaming (for now we use `entity_picture`, which already refreshes on entity state change).
- HVAC colour-gradient interpolation (still waiting on the secondary-entity schema; tracked for a later minor).
- Web Worker offload for pathfinding (if telemetry warrants it).
- Unit + integration tests (v1.0.0).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Weather-aware background transitions.** The card now renders two stacked background `<div>` layers and crossfades between them whenever the resolved background URL changes. The incoming image is preloaded via `new Image()` before the opacity flip to avoid a blank frame; the old layer is cleared on a timer after the transition completes so it's ready for the next swap. `background.transition_duration` is respected (default 2000 ms).
- **Editor: Backgrounds & weather panel.** New collapsible `<details>` panel in the editor for the default image URL, the weather entity (autocompleted from `weather.*` entities in `hass`), the transition duration, and an editable table of `state → image URL` rows with thumbnail previews. New rows pick the next unused known weather state (sunny, cloudy, rainy, …). Every edit pushes one undoable patch with a descriptive label.
- New editor command helpers: `setBackgroundDefault`, `setWeatherEntity`, `setTransitionDuration`, `setWeatherStateImage`, `deleteWeatherState`, `renameWeatherState`.

### Changed

- Card version banner bumped to 0.4.0.

### Deferred to later versions

- Actual in-card image upload. HA's filesystem upload is out of scope for a Lovelace card; users still place images under `/local/` or `/hacsfiles/` as usual and reference them by URL — the panel just makes the mapping discoverable instead of requiring raw YAML.
- HVAC colour-gradient interpolation (still tracked, deferred until the secondary-entity schema work).
- Overlay editor (v0.5.0).
- Unit + integration tests (v1.0.0).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- **Auto-route pathfinding** via Sobel edge detection + A* over a coarse cost grid (`src/pathfinding/`):
  - `sobel.ts` — downscale the background image to ≤480×270, greyscale with Rec. 709 coefficients, separable 3×3 Gaussian blur, Sobel Gx/Gy, magnitude with a 30-threshold noise floor.
  - `grid-builder.ts` — aggregates the edge map into an 8×8-pixel cost grid. Each cell's cost is `255 − max(edge in cell)` so A* naturally prefers to travel along visible architectural features.
  - `astar.ts` — 4-directional A* with an admissible Manhattan heuristic, a binary-heap frontier, and a +50 turn penalty to avoid zig-zag tie-breakers.
  - `simplify.ts` — removes collinear intermediate cells so only direction-changes become waypoints.
  - `index.ts` — public `suggestPath({ imageUrl, from, to })` with a URL-keyed grid cache. Pipeline yields between stages to stay out of the long-task bucket.
- **Editor: Suggest path** enabled when a flow is selected. Shows a dashed orange preview overlay with per-waypoint markers and an accept/cancel bar. Accept pushes a single undoable patch (`auto-route <flowId>`). Reports elapsed time and gives an actionable message when the source image is cross-origin tainted.

### Changed

- Toolbar's Suggest-path button now reflects flow selection and busy state instead of being permanently disabled.

### Deferred to later versions

- **Web Worker offload for the pathfinding pipeline.** The spec calls for worker offload when processing is estimated above 100 ms; measured cost for a 480×270 edge map plus A* on a ~60×34 grid is consistently well under that, so v0.3 runs on the main thread with small yields between stages. The pipeline stages are already pure and ready to move into a worker in a later polish if telemetry warrants it.
- HVAC colour-gradient interpolation (still waiting on the secondary-entity schema; tracked for a later minor).
- Weather-state background transitions (v0.4.0).
- Overlay editor (v0.5.0).
- Unit + integration tests (v1.0.0).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- All six domain flow profiles implemented with spec-exact parameters: energy, water, network, hvac, gas, generic. `FlowProfile` now carries optional `particle_count_curve` (used by network to vary packet density) and `wave_amplitude_curve` (used by water/hvac wave shapes).
- **Houdini Paint Worklet renderer** (`src/flowme-painter-worklet.js` + `src/animation/houdini-renderer.ts`). Worklet source is inlined into the bundle at build time (via Vite `?raw`) and loaded at runtime through a Blob URL, so HACS users still install a single file. The worklet draws dots, squares, sinusoidal waves and expanding pulses; animation is driven by a CSS `@keyframes` rule on `--flowme-progress` after `CSS.registerProperty`.
- **Renderer factory feature detection** (`src/animation/renderer-factory.ts`): uses Houdini when `CSS.paintWorklet` and `CSS.registerProperty` are both available; falls back to SVG otherwise. Override with `?flowme_renderer=svg` or `?flowme_renderer=houdini` in the URL.
- Extended SVG renderer to support all four shapes (dot, square, wave, pulse). Wave is rendered as an animated dashed stroked path; pulse renders as stationary expanding circles at evenly spaced anchor points.
- **Editor overhaul** (`src/flowme-card-editor.ts` + `src/editor/`):
  - `UndoStack` — 100-deep undo/redo with a command description for each patch; push one patch per drag (on pointer-up).
  - `editor/commands.ts` — pure functions for moveNode, addNode, deleteNode, moveWaypoint, insertWaypoint, deleteWaypoint, setNodeLabel, setNodeEntity, addFlow, deleteFlow, setFlowEntity.
  - `flowme-editor-toolbar` — Add node, Add flow, Suggest path (disabled until v0.3), Undo, Redo, Preview toggle, Save.
  - Waypoint handles that drag along the canvas; Shift-drag snaps to 8% grid. Shift-click on a flow segment inserts a waypoint at that point. Right-click deletes nodes (with confirm) and waypoints (immediate).
  - Keyboard: ⌘Z / Ctrl+Z = undo, ⌘⇧Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y = redo.
  - Inspector pane: rename node, set entity, delete node / flow.

### Changed

- Vite library config simplified to a single-file output. Worklet is inlined rather than split into a separate chunk (keeps HACS installs one file).
- Generic profile describe() now formats values with sensible precision.

### Deferred to later versions

- HVAC colour-gradient interpolation between two source-entity temperatures (requires secondary-entity wiring through the config schema and inspector; kept deferred to v0.3+).
- Auto-routing / "Suggest path" button enablement (v0.3.0).
- Weather-state background transitions (v0.4.0).
- Overlay editor (v0.5.0).
- Unit + integration tests (v1.0.0).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added

- Repo scaffolded with Vite 5 + Lit 3 + TypeScript 5 in strict mode.
- MIT license, HACS manifest, ESLint flat config, CI workflow (lint + type-check + build + dist freshness guard).
- Full type definitions for cards, nodes, flows, overlays and flow profiles (`src/types.ts`).
- Utility helpers (`src/utils.ts`): `clamp`, `lerp`, percent/pixel conversions, polyline path length and point-at-progress sampler.
- Strict configuration validator (`src/validate-config.ts`) with field-path error messages.
- Energy domain flow profile (`src/flow-profiles/energy.ts`) with spec-exact speed curve. The other five domains (water, network, hvac, gas, generic) fall back to a generic dot profile until v0.2.
- SVG-based flow renderer (`src/animation/svg-renderer.ts`) using `animateMotion` with the restart-on-speed-change workaround and 200 ms debounce.
- Renderer factory (`src/animation/renderer-factory.ts`) — always returns SVG in v0.1; Houdini path lands in v0.2.
- Main card (`src/flowme-card.ts`) — full Lovelace lifecycle: `setConfig`, `set hass`, `willUpdate`, `render`, `getCardSize`, `getConfigElement`, `getStubConfig`. Registers `<flowme-card>` as `custom:flowme-card` and advertises via `window.customCards`.
- Minimal config editor (`src/flowme-card-editor.ts`) — click-to-add-node on a background preview, drag existing nodes, YAML fallback.

### Deferred to later versions

- Houdini Paint Worklet renderer + feature-detect factory (v0.2.0).
- Five remaining domain profiles with their spec-accurate parameters (v0.2.0).
- Full drag editor: waypoint handles, line-insertion, toolbar, undo/redo, snap-to-grid (v0.2.0).
- Sobel + A* auto-routing (v0.3.0).
- Weather-state background transitions (v0.4.0).
- Overlay editor (v0.5.0).
- Unit + integration tests (v1.0.0).
